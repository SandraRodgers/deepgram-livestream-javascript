# deepgram-livestream-javascript

This is the example project (the vanilla Javascript version) to go along with the tutorial How to Build a Live Streaming Web Application with Amazon IVS and Deepgram found at https://developers.deepgram.com/blog/2022/03/build-a-livestream-web-application-with-amazon-ivs-and-deepgram/

## Live streaming

To see your livestream, be sure to:

- Download [Open Broadcast Software](https://obsproject.com/) software
- Set up an AWS account and create an [Amazon IVS](https://aws.amazon.com/ivs/) account
- Configure the stream to connect (follow instructions in the [tutorial](https://developers.deepgram.com/blog/2022/03/build-a-livestream-web-application-with-amazon-ivs-and-deepgram/))

## Captions

To use Deepgram speech-to-text API, [set up an account](https://console.deepgram.com/signup). This will give you $150 in free credit without the need to enter a credit card.
